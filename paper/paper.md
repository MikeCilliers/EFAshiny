# Summary

We develop a shiny application, EFAshiny, for exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed to free users from scripting in R by wrapping together various packages for data management, factor analysis, and graphics. EFAshiny provides visualization of factor loadings with confidence intervals to facilitate proper interpretation of extracted factors. Results of analysis in tables and graphs are presented on-line and can be exported. Features of EFAshiny are demonstrated with a real data example.
